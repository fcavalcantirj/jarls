### 2026-01-25: Infrastructure - Monorepo Initialization

**Feature Completed**: "Monorepo initialized with npm workspaces"

**Work Done**:
- Created root package.json with pnpm workspaces configuration
- Created pnpm-workspace.yaml for workspace configuration
- Created packages/shared, packages/server, packages/client directories
- Set up package.json for each package with appropriate dependencies:
  - @jarls/shared: Core shared types package
  - @jarls/server: Node.js game server with tsx for development
  - @jarls/client: React + Vite frontend
- Created tsconfig.base.json with strict TypeScript settings
- Created tsconfig.json for each package with project references
- Added basic source files demonstrating cross-package imports
- Verified pnpm install works correctly from root

### 2026-01-25: Infrastructure - TypeScript Configuration Verified

**Feature Completed**: "TypeScript configured for all packages"

**Verification**:
- Root tsconfig.base.json exists with shared compiler options (target ES2022, strict mode, etc.)
- Each package (shared, server, client) has tsconfig.json extending ../../tsconfig.base.json
- TypeScript project references configured: server and client reference ../shared
- Strict mode enabled via `"strict": true` in tsconfig.base.json
- `pnpm typecheck` passes for all packages

**Files Verified**:
- tsconfig.base.json
- packages/shared/tsconfig.json
- packages/server/tsconfig.json
- packages/client/tsconfig.json

### 2026-01-25: Infrastructure - Shared Types Importable

**Feature Completed**: "Shared types importable from @jarls/shared"

**Work Done**:
- Added core game types to packages/shared/src/index.ts:
  - AxialCoord, CubeCoord interfaces for hexagonal coordinates
  - PieceType type and Piece interface
  - Player interface
  - GameConfig interface
  - GamePhase type
  - GameState interface (the main shared type)
- Updated server to import GameState: `import { GameState } from '@jarls/shared'`
- Updated client to import GameState: `import { GameState } from '@jarls/shared'`
- Built shared package to generate dist folder with type declarations
- Verified `pnpm typecheck` passes for all packages
- Verified `pnpm test` passes for all packages

**Files Modified**:
- packages/shared/src/index.ts (added all core game types)
- packages/server/src/index.ts (added GameState import and usage)
- packages/client/src/App.tsx (added GameState import and usage)
